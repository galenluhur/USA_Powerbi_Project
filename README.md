This semester, I completed an in-depth data visualization project using Power BI, where I designed 20 interactive dashboards. The dataset analyzed key metrics of U.S. cities, including:

-City Size
-Population
-Average Income
-Unemployment Rate
-Average Rent

This project allowed me to enhance my skills in creating clear and impactful visualizations to convey meaningful insights. It was an exciting challenge, and Iâ€™m proud of the results.

Iâ€™d like to showcase some of the best visualizations I developed and share them with others interested in data analytics.

ðŸ”” Please note: The dataset used is not entirely accurate and is intended solely for educational purposes, with a focus on visual design.

I welcome any feedback or connections with professionals passionate about data visualization and analytics!
